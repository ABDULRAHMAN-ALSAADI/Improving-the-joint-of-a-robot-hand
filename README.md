# 🔩 Enhanced Arm Joint | Static Simulation

## 📌 Overview

This is an improved design of an arm joint from my internship with Smart Methods Co, desgined and tested using SolidWorks.

## 🔬 Simulation Setup

- Simulation Type: Static
- Material: ABS Plastic
- Load: 100 N per edge
- Fixtures: Fixed bottom face
- Mesh: Fine (automatically refined for better accuracy)

## 📈 Results - von Mises Stress

- Max von Mises Stress: ~1.78 MPa

- Yield Strength of ABS: ~40 MPa

- Factor of Safety: ~22.47 → Safe Design

💡 The stress is concentrated near the loading edges but remains well below the yield limit, confirming that the design is safe under static loading conditions.
